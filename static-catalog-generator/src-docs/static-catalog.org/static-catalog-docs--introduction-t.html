<p>A lot of the data we encounter is static, meaning that it will not change anymore. Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The results of an exam</li>
<li>The results of a census</li>
<li>Other measured or statistical data for a period in the past</li>
<li>The product prices for a specific day</li>
<li>The books entered in a library in specific period of time</li>
<li>A catalog of products until changed</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is usually kept in a data base in order to be searched by a client with different filters, or in other cases just offered as download of an XLS or CSV, in order to be opened in Excel and searched there.
However this data is read only, it cannot be modified by the client or the server because by its nature would make no sense</p>
<p>The idea here is to leave the data on server, but put it in such a format that would be possible to be searched from the client (from browser) without server intervention other than transmitting the data to the client. In fact the data will follow the format of database, with index files, keyword files, sort files and data block files, but instead of these files to be used on server, they will be transferred as need and used on browser, this way the server will see them as any other static data (images, styles, pages), and the browser will do the actual search processing.</p>
<p>The advantages are clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more database, with problems of version, backup, export, downtime etc.</li>
<li>No more server side code, with problems of PHP version, Drupal version, version compatibility between server components, performance etc.</li>
<li>The export/import of the data is becoming a simple operation of copy files.</li>
<li>The type/version of the server is not important anymore, any HTTP server works.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>static-catalog</strong> is composed of two main components:</p>
<ol>
<li>A desktop application which takes the data and generates the server files</li>
<li>A JS engine which is part of the generation and is doing the actual search in the browser</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to generate a search-able catalog, the data should be provided as a CSV file. The creation of the CSV file is external to <strong>static-catalog</strong> but the way it is created impacts a lot on the quality of the result.
The application will generate the catalog as a set of files. There are two distinct categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>The catalog files containing the data on which the search is done, these are independent of the web page design</li>
<li>The page files, these are specific to the web page, and will use a special data file in order to know the search data. These files should be provided to the application, as they are specific to the web site. The application can help however if the page is given as a “.liquid” template and inside it follows the page data rules, the application will take it and create the web (html) page.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally the resulted catalog files should be copied on the server, and verified if it works as intended, and if not it can be regenerated with different filters, sort options or page settings.</p>
